"""Shared rules for reading an issue-analysis.md file.

check_analysis.py, sync_stakeholders.py and build_json.py use these
functions, so the three scripts find sections and tables the same way.
No code runs on import.

Rules:
- A section starts at the first ## or ### heading whose text starts with the
  given prefix, followed by a space, 「：」 or the end of the line. So
  "### 6.1" does not match "### 6.10". The section ends at the next ## or
  ### heading.
- A table is a header line that starts with "|", a separator line such as
  "|---|---|", and the "|" lines after it.
- Cells are split on " | " (a space, a bar, a space). So a cell must not
  contain " | ".
- The step 1 stakeholder tables are all the tables in the section
  "### 1.1", up to the next heading.
- The step 4 story IDs are the first cells of the table rows under
  "## 步驟 4", up to the next heading.
- A reference to another issue is written as 「#」, the issue number, one
  space, then a story ID or a stakeholder ID: 「#2 O01-US01」 or 「#2 O03」
  (CROSS_REF). Such a reference is not a local ID of the file it is in.
- A source tag is one of TAGS in square brackets, for example [AI整理].
  In Markdown it is wrapped in backticks (`[AI整理]`); the CSV keeps the
  plain tag. All scripts use TAGS, so a new tag is added here only.
